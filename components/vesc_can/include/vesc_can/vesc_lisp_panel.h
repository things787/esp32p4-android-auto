    LISP-driven quick-action panel transport.

    A "master" LISP script running on the VESC describes a small panel of
    controls (toggles / buttons / numbers / read-only labels) and their live
    state; the P4 renders it (Super_VESC_Display/custom/lisp_panel.c) and sends
    back interactions. The wire channel is COMM_CUSTOM_APP_DATA (id 36): the
    firmware delivers it to the LISP `event-data-rx` event, and the script
    replies with `(send-data buf 2 <reply-can-id>)` (FW 6.05+ explicit-CAN
    routing — see the plan for why "last interface" is not relied upon).

    Application frame (the COMM_CUSTOM_APP_DATA byte is added/stripped by the
    firmware on both ends, so it never appears here):

        [magic 'V'(0x56) 'P'(0x50)] [msg_type] [payload...]

    P4 -> LISP  (msg_type, then always [u8 reply_can_id]):
        REQ_UI    0x01  []
        ACTION    0x02  [u8 ctrl_id][i32 value*1000]
        REQ_STATE 0x03  []

    LISP -> P4:
        UI_DESC   0x81  [u8 ver][u8 count] then per control:
                        [u8 id][u8 type][str label]
                        TOGGLE: [u8 state]
                        BUTTON: (nothing)
                        NUMBER: [i32 min*1000][i32 max*1000][i32 step*1000]
                                [i32 value*1000][str suffix]
                        LABEL : [i32 value*1000][str suffix]
        STATE     0x82  [u8 count] then per control: [u8 id][i32 value*1000]

    All multi-byte integers are big-endian (buffer.h). Floats travel as
    int32 = round(value * 1000) so both ends agree without an IEEE float
    repack (the VESC float32_auto format is not available to LispBM).
